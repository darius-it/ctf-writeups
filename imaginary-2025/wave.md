## My solution
As the description hints, this challenge is fairly simple and does not require complicated techniques of getting the secret flag from the audio file.

You can simply use the `strings` tool (preinstalled on Linux/macOS, can be installed from Sysinternals for Windows) to find the flag in the file's metadata:

And that's it! We have found the flag 🎉
